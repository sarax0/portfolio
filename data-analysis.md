### Analyzing Sales Trends and Patterns Using Tableau

I built a detailed Tableau dashboard with multiple tabs to analyze customer demographics, product profitability, and sales trends. This dashboard helps users understand key patterns and make informed decisions to drive revenue growth.

### AdventureWorks Sales Insights: Power BI Analysis

The dashboard provides a clear view of key metrics, including reseller performance, employee sales figures, and product trends. It features real-time data updates and custom visuals to help users dive deeper into sales information. Key elements include a date filter for tracking different time periods, a drillthrough feature for detailed employee insights, and a panel for managing slicers. I also handled binary image data by converting it to Base64, making it easy to display pictures directly in the reports.
