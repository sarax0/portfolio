### Deep NLP for text deepfak detection

Text deepfak detection is the automated task of determining whether a piece of text contains  artificially generated content. In this project, I utilized PyTorch to fine-tune BERT and Ro-BERT models for English text, AraBERT for Arabic text, and Multilingual BERT for multilingual capabilities.
